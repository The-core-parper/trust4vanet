----------- Overall evaluation -----------
The paper addresses an interesting and relevant topic: a formal interpretration of model of reputation and trust in VANET, a component of intelligent transportation systems. Basing reputation and trust on formal foudnations is extremely important when safety considerations are involved, and this topic is understudied in the context of VANET. 

However, the paper is extremely difficult to read, which makes it very difficult to assess the contribution and the correctness of the proposed constructions. It starts with a very confused presentation of the syntax of the framework. 


For instance, two types of formulas are presented: first Boolean formulas are mentioned, which constitute messages. Then the notion of formulae is defined (Definition 2), meaning something else completely.


[GP]
----I am changing the term in Definition 2 to judgement to avoid the confusion


Definitions 2 and 3 are not really definitions, but notations. 


[GP]
---is it not standard to introduce this notation by definition??

The syntactic constructs on which the deduction system manipulates remain very unclear. For instance,  the use of ':profile' is never defined as part of the syntax. Is {}:profile a formula?  A Boolean formula (message)? This is not defined. 

[GP]
----added a sentence explaining that $:profile$ is a typing judgement. I have revised also the rules.



Another point: the authors provide a deduction system for reasoning about trust and reputation. But how do we know it is useful, i.e., correctly describing reality? I would expect to have some soundness/completeness results included in the paper. If it is impossible to define semantics for the system - perhaps you could comment on this issue?

PAPER: 6
TITLE: A Proof-theoretic Trust and Reputation Model for VANET

Overall evaluation: 1

----------- Overall evaluation -----------
The paper proposes a proof-theoretic model for assessing reputation and trust in vehicular ad-hoc networks.

The paper fits in the topic of the workshop, in particular it considers trustworthiness and reputation properties which are
related to both security and safety in the transportation domain.

The proposal is original: it relies on a trust and reputation ontology-driven model proposed in literature, properly cited, and
provides a proof-theoretic translation of such model to a natural deduction calculus called (un)SecureND.

The main drawback of the paper is the presentation of the approach and the organization, as detailed in the following.

- Since the approach is based on a previous work in the literature, a background on the contribution of the latter 
should be included to make the paper self-contained.
For example, the algorithm in section 3 is based on the the opportunistic forwarding decision process
in [14] and the definitions in section 4 are related to the ones defined in the reputation model in [14] 


[GP]
------ The algorithm in Section 3 is explained and I do not believe it is hard to understand. I have rephrased the sentence preceding it. As for the Reputation model of Section 4, although it is an adaptation of [14], I believe it is self-contained: to make it easier to understand, I have started now the section with an informal explanation of the whole model.


 
- The section 2 is very dense, especially to readers with no expertise in proof-theoretic semantics like this reviewer.
In particular, for each set of rules used to define the model, a table is provided with all the rule definitions.
Since the set of rules are also briefly explained in each subsection, this reviewer suggests to keep just one of the figures to
illustrate the (un)SecureND calculus, and to exploit the space  to show how non-trustworthy interactions can be proven through
a proof-checking method (as stated in the introduction) and to provide more details about how the model has been validated using
the Coq library.

----------- Overall evaluation -----------
This paper presents a novel approach to formal verification of trust and reputation in VANET communication. This approach is based on the natural deduction calculus (un)SecureND; proposed by the first two authors in previous publications. 
The paper is very well motivated, and illustrates the application of the method with a realistic case. But I found the concepts introduced in Section 2 very difficult to grasp, which impaired my general understanding of the paper, and that is why I score it as borderline.

In Section 2, many notions are discussed as self-evident, while in my opinion they are very specific to this work and need a more careful explanation.



Examples:
i) "(...) introduced in [10] for the positive fragment, and in [9] for the negation complete extension". What is positive fragment? what is negation complete extension?


[GP]
rephrased to help


ii) Services and Service characteristics are never defined. No illustrative example is given. So all the subsequent discussion about order, identifiers, set of messages and vehicle-generated services cannot be understood.


[GP]
entered list of examples of services in introduction



iii) What does it mean that "a vehicle profile \Gamma^v_i might validate a message (...)?" What does message validation represent here?

 
[GP]
rephrased


iv) "A valid vehicle profile meets all the requirements and conflicts causes of all service messages that the user collects" Which user? what is a "conflict cause"? how requirements and conflict causes are met?


[GP]
Added phrase


v) What is an "installation profile"?


[GP]
error, fixed


Without examples or more detailed explanations, all these concepts are very fuzzy.

Additionally, the concept of "transitive operation" or "transitive message passing operation" is mentioned in the Intro, but from the context  it is not clear what this means.

[GP]
added small edit


The examples and rules given in Section 3 and 4 kind of compensate this lack of information and by the end of the paper, the reader understands the motivation and benefits of the presented method. But Section 2 needs to be re-worked, in my opinion.
